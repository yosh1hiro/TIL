# Today I Learned
This repo is where I output what I learned today.

## Plan
- Create a branch in a day. And the branch name is timestamp.
- I create Pull Request with the branch at end of the day. PR will be description of the branch that means I write what I learn today.
- Directory Strategy is tree structure. root shows subject. it's a lax rule.
